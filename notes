there is no class that can only take place on monday, or only wed or only friday, so using the mwf template will be okay for classes that are for two days. but also use the tu,th template
 calc 2 time, and discrete math time
 if a course has a freq attribute 2, then we also generate for Tuesday, and Thur
 perhaps a prof, does not want to teach on either friday,m, then if the freq is 2, the utility score still increases

 let's assign prof to groups after each instantiation, and then when we want to find the profs that can teach a certain course, we get the course's id and the prof that are associdated with that id
 so 

 organize the courses by utility
 set a boolean to run
 pop the first course from the list
 pass it to the successor function
 create all possible valid combinations
 for every comb, create all valid comb, and pass to the successor function. 
 once the max score is reached we can return and set the boolean to false so we can exit the loop

 courses are now organized. we need to move from --abcde to abcde--
 keep track of which index we want to next draw from do this wile boolean =true
